## What I learned

I learned a lot about how to customize graphs to your own liking that will create the most self-explanatory graphs. One thing I think will be difficult is knowing which features to use at the right time. 



## Importing data



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nba<-read_csv("historical_RAPTOR_by_player.csv")
nba

```

## Manipulations

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
nbatop <- filter(nba, raptor_total > 20)
nbatop
```

## Plot

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nbatop)+
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = raptor_offense, y = raptor_defense, color = player_name))
```

## Export

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write_csv(nbatop, "nbatop.csv")
```
