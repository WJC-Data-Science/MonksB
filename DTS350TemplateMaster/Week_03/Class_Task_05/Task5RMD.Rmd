```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## What I learned
I learned a lot about how to customize graphs to your own liking that will create the most self-explanatory graphs. One thing I think will be difficult is knowing which features to use at the right time. 



## Importing data



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
nba<-read_csv("historical_RAPTOR_by_player.csv")
nba
nbatop <- filter(nba, raptor_total > 20)
nbatop
ggplot(nbatop)+
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = raptor_offense, y = raptor_defense, color = player_name))

write_csv(nbatop, "nbatop.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
