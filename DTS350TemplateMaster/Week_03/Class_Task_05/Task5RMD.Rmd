## What I learned
I learned a lot about how to customize graphs to your own liking that will create the most self-explanatory graphs. One thing I think will be difficult is knowing which features to use at the right time. 



## Importing data



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
nba<-read_csv("historical_RAPTOR_by_player.csv")
nba
nbatop <- filter(nba, raptor_total > 20)
nbatop
ggplot(nbatop)+
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = raptor_offense, y = raptor_defense, color = player_name))

write_csv(nbatop, "nbatop.csv")
```
