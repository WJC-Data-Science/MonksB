## Graph and 20-row head

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(downloader)


messy_data1 <- read_xlsx("messy_data.xlsx", skip = 2, col_names = FALSE)


messy_data_del <- subset(messy_data1, select = -c(3,4,6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16) ) 

messy_df <- messy_data_del %>%
  pivot_longer(c('...5','...8','...11','...14','...17'), names_to = "Class",values_to = "Grades") %>%
  na.omit()

ggplot(data = messy_df)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Grades, fill = Grades))

head(messy_df, 20)

```

## Description

It appears as though the classes are having a positive affect on the students. From the graph, you can see the majority of the grades are in the "A" bar, and they steadily decrease. There is a slight concerning bump in the "F" bar, but that could probably be explained by people that are thinking about changing majors.
